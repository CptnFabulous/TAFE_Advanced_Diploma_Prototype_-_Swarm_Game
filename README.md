# TAFE_Advanced_Diploma_Prototype_-_Swarm_Game
A prototype game I developed in three hours with another TAFE student, Kevin Huasaming. Control a replicating swarm of monsters as you increase your numbers and fight off enemy creatures in an increasingly crowded game environment.
Controls:
•	WASD/arrow keys to move your swarm
•	Z to make your creatures attack in the direction they are facing.
•	X to make your creatures consume corpses in the direction they are facing, gaining new numbers.
